About the Morse Code Font
-------------------------

The Morse code font is handy for anyone studying Morse code because you can type the letters on your keyboard and see the results onscreen visually in dots and dashes. The font could be used to quickly create test messages or you could even use the font to print off homemade Morse code flashcards to help you memorize the Morse code alphabet.

This font now includes English and Japanese Katakana Morse code characters. Since the Morse Code font uses bezier curves for the characters it looks great even at giant font sizes like 4000 pt. 

For your convenience, the font is now available in two formats: TrueType and OpenType


Why a Morse Code Font?
----------------------

I have always been interested in typography and seeing the works of typeface designers and type foundries. My first real experience with using fonts on a computer was when I got an Apple Mac 128K computer with MacWrite and MacPaint. I enjoyed using interesting fonts in layouts and designs.

I have enjoyed reading the MyFonts newsletters since I subscribed in 2008. They profile designers from around the world in their Creative Characters: The faces behind the fonts articles.

When I came across the open source program FontForge by George Williams I thought I would try creating some of my own experimental fonts. I am still learning about creating fonts and will probably update my font creations as I learn more.

Here is the first result: a free Morse Code font.

Version History
---------------
Version 1.0 - April 1, 2010
The first version of my Morse Code font was created on April 1, 2010. It featured medium weight, outline, and shadow varieties.

Version 2.0 -  Jan 1, 2012
The 2nd version of the Morse Code font was released on Jan 1, 2012. I reduced the number of font varieties and improved the font accuracy. I would like to thank Dan Romanchik for his correction on the letter Q.

Version 2.1 - March 10, 2012
The latest version of the font, Morse Code version 2.1, adds support for the extended Morse code characters. I improved the rendering of the Morse dots at large font sizes by switching from polygon outlines to bezier curves.

Version 2.2 - March 21, 2012
After I updated the Morse code font in version 2.1 I accidentally added an extra dit to the letter Z. Version 2.2 fixes this issue. Thanks N8DRT for letting me know!

Version 2.3 - June 27, 2012
I updated the paragraph character to use a bezier curve.

Version 2.4 - Feb 8, 2013
Added Japanese Expanded Katakana symbols.

Version 2.5 - March 15, 2013
Fixed the morse code version of the lowercase letter v.
